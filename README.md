# MEDEC.HEMONC
MEDEC.HEMONC dataset: A synthetic clinical vignette dataset focused on hematology and oncology questions. The approach is adapted from Ben Abacha et al. (2024) in their work on the MEDEC benchmark. Original vignettes were derived from the MedQA USMLE-style question repository.
Discharge summaries: 90 synthetic clinical letters (30 profiles with 3 variations in lengths each) were generated using Claude 3.7 Sonnet mode (Anthropic). Letters included dense clinical data (pathology, radiology, labs, medications). A clinical expert reviewed each letter and injected one predefined, clinically relevant error. The injected errors spanned several categories: medication contraindication (n=14), incorrect dosing or administration dates (n=10), omission of essential medication (n=10), overlooked important lab values (n=14), overlooked critical clinical findings (n=8), inappropriate therapy selection or sequence (n=13), incorrect risk classification or staging (n=16), and wrong diagnosis (n=5).
